- assuming that all IMAP clients are running the protocol
- possible TODO: figure out what it looks like when something on the server was changed by another imap client.
- input on encryption method?
- opportunistically add messages to index

## notes from meeting during the second to last week in February
### Threats
- "oblivious RAM"
- reupload how many
- what can we at a time guarantee
- traffic analysis
- deleting correlation
- consider the boxes

### Adding a new client
- need existing device when setting up new one twenty ??? or from password
- DH over header
- type in thing you see
- encrypt UID into contents so you know it's the message you asked for

### Rollback
- keep version number of index
- index contains a table of id --> hash ciphertext, is associated with a particular state of the system
- no reason to change blob without changing index
- every time you update, increase version number in index
- (something that's probably good to handle although I may not) pull before you push/ multiple clients acting simultaneously

### Measurements
- size of data structures
- function of messages, size
- performance, how many touched,
- how many messages sent back and forth
- total IMAP storage
- bulk move --> factor

### Ciphertext
- plaintext
- cost of packetization vs. pkt size
- cost, storage vs. how big to make packets
- how big are my personal real messages?
