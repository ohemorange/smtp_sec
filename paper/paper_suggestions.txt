In describing the socialist millionaires protocol, say that the protocol requires users to exchange or compare information via an out-of-band channel, such as a phone call.  And that in practice that will only work if the users already know each other (otherwise an impostor can MITM them).


The sections vary drastically in length.  Can you refactor or relabel to reduce the disparity?





Comments:
- note that for mixing, we have to reencrypt + save nonce (in the section on encryption)
- Is the section on mailboxes clearer? It's currently 8.2 on page 17 but that might change.
